## 6.2.7
  - Build: skip shadowing jar dependencies [#187](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-tcp/pull/187)
    * plugin no longer shadows dependencies into its *logstash-input-tcp.jar*
    * log4j-api is now a provided dependency and is no longer packaged with the plugin

## 6.2.6

## 6.2.0
 - Added ECS Compatibility Mode [#165](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-tcp/pull/165)
   - When operating in an ECS Compatibility mode, metadata about the connection on which we are receiving data is nested in well-named fields under `[@metadata][input][tcp]` instead of at the root level.
 - Fix: source address is no longer missing when a proxy is present

## 6.1.1
 - Changed jar dependencies to reflect newer versions [#179](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/pull/179)

## 6.0.6
  - Updated Netty dependencies. Additionally, this release removes the dependency on `tcnative` +
    `boringssl`, using JVM supplied ciphers instead. This may result in fewer ciphers being available if the JCE
    unlimited strength jurisdiction policy is not installed. (This policy is installed by default on versions of the
    JDK from u161 onwards)[#157](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-tcp/pull/157)

 - properly convert sslsubject to string before assigning to event field, added specs, see https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-tcp/pull/38

## 3.0.0
 - Deprecate ssl_cacert as it's confusing, does it job but when willing to add a chain of certificated the name and behaviour is a bit confusing.
 - Add ssl_extra_chain_certs that allows you to specify a list of certificates path that will be added to the CAStore.
 - Make ssl_verify=true as a default value, if using ssl and performing validation is not reasonable as security might be compromised.
